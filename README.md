# Hi there! I'm Leo Bertini üåäü™∏üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

- I'm an Oceanographer and proud computer geek.
- I'm interested in combining concepts across disciplines and technologies to aid in our understanding of the natural world. 
- I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Bristol developing advanced image processing pipelines to process 3D X-ray ¬µCT data of coral skeletons, coupling these to machine learning and remote sensing data to investigate changes in coral growth in understudied regions of SE Asia. 
- I also have a joint MSc in Marine Biological Resources by the University of Bergen (Norway) and the University of Ghent (Belgium) and a BSc in Oceanography from the University of S√£o Paulo (Brazil).
